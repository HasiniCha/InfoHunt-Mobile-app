This is a new React Native project, bootstrapped using @react-native-community/cli.
Getting Started
Note: Make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions till the "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

bash
Copy code
# using npx
npx react-native start
This will start the Metro Bundler.

Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
bash
Copy code
# using npx
npx react-native run-android
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Congratulations! 
You've successfully run your React Native app. :partying_face:
